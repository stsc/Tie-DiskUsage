NAME
    Tie::DiskUsage - Tie disk usage to a hash

SYNOPSIS
     use Tie::DiskUsage;

     # common use
     tie %usage, 'Tie::DiskUsage', '/var', '-h';
     print $usage{'/var/log'};
     untie %usage;

     # also implemented
     exists $usage{'/var/log'};
     keys   %usage;
     values %usage;
     each   %usage;
     scalar %usage;

     # fatal error
     %usage = ();
     delete $usage{'/var/log'};
     $usage{'/var/log'} = 1024 ** 2;

DESCRIPTION
    "Tie::DiskUsage" ties the disk usage, which is extracted from the output
    of du(1), to a hash. If the path to perform the "du" command on is
    "undef", the current working directory will be examined; options to "du"
    may be passed at the end of the "tie" invocation with a string provided
    per option.

    By default, the location of the "du" command is assumed to be at
    /usr/bin/du; if "du" cannot be found there, "File::Which" will attempt
    to gather its real location.

    The default path to "du" may be overridden by setting the global
    $Tie::DiskUsage::DU_BIN (usually not needed due to "File::Which"'s
    automatic search for "du").

BUGS & CAVEATS
    Processing output of du(1) requires that each output line is ended by a
    newline.

    In order to successfully run du(1) on a given path, you might need to
    elevate permissions of the process using "Tie::DiskUsage".
